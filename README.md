The Note Panel project is basically a panel of post-its for notes and tasks. I usually use it to map out thoughts and ideas in the process of designing projects. The notes are saved in LocalStorage, ensuring that they are available when the page is reopened. The user can add, move, edit and delete notes. Note Panel was developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As simple as it looks, the project still contains flaws. But the main features are ok!
